# Spring

If you want to launch a project:
1. in a file "src/main/resources/database.properties.origin" write your database data. then change name 
	of this file to database.properties (remove .origin from name)
2. download all dependencies in pom.xml
3. For some projects if it's required create your db (use file "Initial sql script.txt" for postgresql. 
	if you use mySQl or something else - just change the sql script a bit)
