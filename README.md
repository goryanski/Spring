# Spring

To launch app (MVC) you need:
1. create your db (use file "Initial sql script.txt" for postgresql. if you use mySQl or something else - just change the sql script a bit)
2. in a file "src/main/resources/database.properties.origin" write your database data. then change name of this file to database.properties (remove .origin from name)
3. download all dependencies in pom.xml
